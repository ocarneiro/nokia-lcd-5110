==============
This repository contains files for use with the Nokia 5110 Graphic LCD module.

It should contain all the files mentioned in my blog for the "Olho de LCD" Project, which you can find in the URL below:
http://umcarneiro.blogspot.com.br/search/label/olho_de_lcd

Here you should find:
- Arduino sketches for testing your Nokia Graphic LCD 84x48;
- Fritzing files for including your LCD Module in your diagrams;
- Anything else related to the project.

Have fun!
Otavio Carneiro
